# Summary
Reliable and diverse labeled reference data are essential for the development of high-quality processing algorithms for human activity classification. AnnoTS is graphical user interface (GUI) built with python that enables fast and easy to use annotation tools for human activity classification and optional feature extraction from time-series data. Configuration for different data and annotation types is straightforward and flexible to use a wide range of data sources and to address many different use cases. 
Features:
-	Upload large datasets
-	Graph multi-dimensional time-series data
-	Graph interactivity (zoom, pan, save options)
-	Customize classifications
-	Click and drag time-locked segmentation
-	Save multidimensional data with time-locked classifications
-	Extract features from time-series

# Statement of need
Currently, there are limited open-source annotation software available that are flexible to work with multidimensional data sources and are available as free open-source standalone executables. `QualAI-Signal` is a gui based annotation software that increases the speed and efficiency of classifying any variety of activities from a variety of time-series data sources.
